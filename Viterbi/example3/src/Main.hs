  See http://hackage.haskell.org/package/logfloat
  This module presents a type for storing numbers in the log-domain.
  The main reason for doing this is to prevent underflow when multiplying
  many small probabilities as is done in Hidden Markov Models and other
  statistical models often used for natural language processing.

  The patient visits three days in a row and the doctor discovers that on the
  first day she feels normal, on the second day she feels cold, on the third day
  she feels dizzy. The doctor has a question: what is the most likely sequence of
  health condition of the patient that would explain these observations?
  This is answered by the Viterbi algorithm.
